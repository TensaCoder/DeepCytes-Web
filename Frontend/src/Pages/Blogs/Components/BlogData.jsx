    paragraphA:
      "Boeing has begun 3D printing parts for the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter as part of an effort to reduce long lead times and improve supply chain efficiency for components that are typically forged. At AUSA 2022, Boeing and ASTRO America displayed the first 3D printed part - a main rotor link assembly - produced on the world's largest 3D metal printer at Rock Island Arsenal. Boeing plans to print additional rotor system parts and conduct full-scale fatigue testing against traditionally forged parts in April 2024. While some parts may still be more suitable for forging due to production volumes, additive manufacturing could be advantageous for low-volume components. ASTRO America is also gathering data to help determine the business case for different production methods.",
